## Hola
I'm Fulvio, from Italy based in Barcelona.
I'm a freelancer software engineer, working mainly with the technologies you see in my Github profile.
My currently active projects are:
- [notion-echo bot](https://www.github.com/fulviodenza/notion-echo)
- [rankore bot](https://www.github.com/fulviodenza/rankore)
- [pills-of-cs bot](https://www.github.com/fulviodenza/pills-of-cs)
- A secret project written in Go and React Native in a remote land that hopely you will hear about in a few month
- Also a book but this is all another story

If you're are wondering if I only work on bot, no, I don't but I like them because they offer a way to have also something useful for your daily life.
